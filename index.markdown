## About Me
I am a physicist located in Berlin, interested in various fields of mathematical physics and numerical analysis. 
I like to dive with one breath and make music with my friends.

### Characteristics: 
Physics-love, Algorithms-fun, Rythm-freedom, Water-needed.

## Research Interests

- **Numerical Methods for PDEs:** adaptive multiresolution, wavelets, volume penalization, conservation laws, high performance computing
- **Model Order Reduction:** shifted proper orthogonal decomposition, front transport reduction, hyper-reduction, transport-dominated systems
- **Machine Learning and Optimization:** physics guided learning, alternating direction methods, matrix product states
- **Physics:** quantum link models, quantum field theory, fluid flows

## News

- **[Dec. 2021]** Our wavelet adaptive POD paper was accepted in ACOM finally after 1 year waiting.
- **[Dec. 2021]** Submitted "Supervised Learning for Multi Zone Sound Field Reproduction under Harsh Environmental Conditions" together with my master student Henry Sallandt and colleague Mathias Lemke
